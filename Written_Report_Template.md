# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project, there are two main deliverables that Louise wanted to see. Because of the success of one of her plays, Louise wanted to know the outcomes of other similar campaigns in association with their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis done was to determine the outcomes of similar campaigns based on their launch date. One of the first things that needed to be done was convert the Unix timestamp into a format that was more readable. Once the conversion was done, the year of the launch date was pulled into a column of it's own. Because Louise was only interested in comparable campaigns, the data was also filtered by parent category: theater. A pivot table and chart was created to show launch dates (by year then grouped by month) and the outcome: canceled, failed, successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
